            <h6 class="GERALD">GERALD.</h6> 
             <p>I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth’s
                secretary.
            </p>

            <h6 class="LADY_HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6> 
             <p>Surely not, Gerald!  It would be most unwise of you.
            What reason can you have?
            </p>

            <h6 class="GERALD">GERALD.</h6> 
             <p>
                 I don’t think I should be suitable for the post.
             </p>

            <h6 class="ALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>  
            <p>
                I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.
                But he says I am not serious enough.
            </p>

                My dear, you really mustn’t talk like that in this
                house.  Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn’t know anything about the wicked society in
                which we all live.  She won’t go into it.  She is far too good.  I
                consider it was a great honour her coming to me last night.  It gave
                quite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.
            </p>

            <h6 class="ALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>  
            <p>
                Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in
                the air.
            </p>

            <h6 class="LADY_HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
            <p>
                My dear, how can you say that?  There is no resemblance
                between the two things at all.  But really, Gerald, what do you mean by
                not being suitable?
            </p>

            <h6 class="GERALD">GERALD.</h6>  
            <p>
                Lord Illingworth’s views of life and mine are too different.
            </p>
